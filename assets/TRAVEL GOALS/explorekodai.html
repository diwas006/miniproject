        <h1>Kodaikanal</h1>

        <p>Kodaikanal is a hill station which is located in Dindigul district in the state of Tamil Nadu, India.
            Its name in the Tamil language means "The Gift of the Forest".Kodaikanal is referred to as the "Princess of Hill stations" 
            and has a long history as a retreat and tourist destination.This hill station town is located at a higher elevation than 
            the nearby plain or valley. The term was used mostly in colonial Asia (particularly in India), but also in Africa (albeit rarely), 
            for towns founded by European colonialists as refuges from the summer heat and, as Dale Kennedy observes about the Indian context, 
            "the hill station ... was seen as an exclusive British preserve: here it was possible to render the Indian into an outsider".
            In India, which has the largest number of hill stations, most are situated at an altitude of 
            approximately 1,000 to 2,500 metres (3,300 to 8,200 ft).
        </p>
        
        <h2>ETYMOLOGY :</h2>

        <p> It is not known who first used this name or what they intended it to mean.

            The word Kodaikanal is an amalgamation of two words: kodai and kanal. The Tamil language has at least four possible 
            interpretations of the name Kodaikanal. By pronouncing the first syllable of Kodaikanal with a long Tamil 'O', as in koe-dei (கோடை), 
            it means "summer", whilst the final two syllables kanal (காணல்) means "to see", rendering Kodaikanal as a "place to see in summer". 
            Kodaikanal is a summer forest, and it is a place that the first missionaries used as a refuge to escape the overbearing and mosquito-ridden 
            heat of the plains – a place that they would have counted on seeing in the summer.
        </p>

        <h2>HISTORY :</h2>

        <p>The earliest residents of Kodaikanal were the Palaiyar tribal people. The earliest specific references to Kodaikanal and the Palani Hills 
            are found in Tamil Sangam literature of the early Common era.Modern Kodaikanal was established by American Christian missionaries and 
            British bureaucrats in 1845, as a refuge from the high temperatures and tropical diseases of the plains.In the 20th century a few elite Indians 
            came to realise the value of this enchanting hill station and started relocating here.Tourism has been impacted by industrial pollution issues 
            including the closure of a mercury factory owned by Unilever's Indian subsidiary Hindustan Unilever after evidence of widespread mercury pollution.
            To date no proper clean-up operation has been mounted.
